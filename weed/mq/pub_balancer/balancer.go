// Balancer collects stats from all brokers.
//
//	When publishers wants to create topics, it picks brokers to assign the topic partitions.
//	When consumers wants to subscribe topics, it tells which brokers are serving the topic partitions.
//
// When a partition needs to be split or merged, or a partition needs to be moved to another broker,
// the balancer will let the broker tell the consumer instance to stop processing the partition.
// The existing consumer instance will flush the internal state, and then stop processing.
// Then the balancer will tell the brokers to start sending new messages in the new/moved partition to the consumer instances.
//
// Failover to standby consumer instances:
//
//	A consumer group can have min and max number of consumer instances.
//	For consumer instances joined after the max number, they will be in standby mode.
//
//	When a consumer instance is down, the broker will notice this and inform the balancer.
//	The balancer will then tell the broker to send the partition to another standby consumer instance.
